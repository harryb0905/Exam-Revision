  question: What is meant by a relational file?
  answer: A relational file contains a number of records. Each record has a defined set of attributes.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the two problems of using a relational file?
  answer: 1) Limit on field lengths. <br> 2) Expense of setting up and maintaining the database. More costs for a bigger organisation as high security for sensitive data is required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the problems of having multiple traditional files?
  answer: 1) More files to maintain. <br> 2) Performance penalty accessing multiple files. <br> 3) Danger of data duplication. <br> 4) Adding/deleting records.

  question: What are the 3 things to abstract from the application software?
  answer: 1) Data structure. <br> 2) Data values. <br> 3) Data access.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain what is meant by data independence.
  answer: Data independence is the idea that generated and stored data should be kept separate from apps that use the data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly describe the components involved in a DBMS.
  answer: 1) App program = send queries, receive results through logical interface. <br><br> 2) DBMS = contains data access software (code to process queries and handle data access), communicates with database. <br><br> 3) Database = physical data on backing store (contains data and data definition metadata).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the two views of DBMS and give some explanation?
  answer: 1) Logical view = presented to applications. <br> 2) Physical layout = on backing store, manipulated by DBMS.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is the purpose of the logical level in a DBMS?
  answer: Can access info without affecting existing apps (allows apps to define subset of logical view they wish to see).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain the purpose of data independence.
  answer: Can organise both contents and structure of the data (provided logical view presented to app programmer and end-user remains consistent).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly explain why databases are perceived to be better than traditional files.
  answer: 1) Data independence. <br> 2) Clever access methods/physical methods help speed up access times.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: How does a database provide data independence?
  answer: Through data abstraction. Doesn't include details of how data is stored, hides storage and implementation details of no interest to most users.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is stored in a system catalogue?
  answer: 1) Data definitions. <br> 2) Storage structure of data items. <br> 3) Constraints.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Describe the problems associated with traditional file processing.
  answer: Users may define and implement files needed for each specific app. Separate files need to be maintained (and programs to manipulate them). Wasted storage, redundant effort to keep common data consistent.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is meant by a view?
  answer: A view contains only what each app wants to see and only what it needs to see, keeping rest hidden (security). May be virtual (not stored) so no wasted space and no redundant effort maintaining common data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain the following terms; Entity, Attributes, Relationships.
  answer: Entity = specific object, real or abstract about which we need to store attributes and relationships. <br><br> Attributes = properties describing an entity. <br><br> Relationships = associations among entites.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a record?
  answer: A collection of related data values, which describe an entity and its attributes.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a record type? Give an example.
  answer: A collection of field names and their corresponding data types. <br><br> Person - String name, Int age, String NI_Number. <br> Person record = instance of person.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a schema?
  answer: A schema allows a user to declare types of records required (e.g. Person) and types of relationships among records. <br><br> A roadmap for data eventually stored (metadata = info about data).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the overhead costs of a DBMS?
  answer: 1) High initial investment in; hardware, software, training. <br> 2) General approach for defining and processing data. <br> 3) Providing security, concurrency control, recovery and integrity functions.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: When not to use DBMS?
  answer: 1) Database is simple and not expected to change. <br> 2) Stringent real-time requirements for some programs = DBMS overhead costs. <br> 3) Multiple-user access to data is not required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the actors involved in a Database System Environment?
  answer: 1) Database Administrator. <br> 2) Database Designers. <br> 3) Software Engineers. <br> 4) End Users.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly explain what a database is.
  answer: A database represents some aspect of a real/mini world, logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Who is a database admin?
  answer: A database admin authorises access to a database, coordinates and monitors its use, and acquires software and hardware resources as required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Who is a database designer?
  answer: A database designer identifies data to be stored in the database, and chooses appropriate structures and constraints to represent and store data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What does a software engineer do in the context of databases?
  answer: A software engineer identifies end user requirements and implements, tests, debugs and maintains.

  question: What is a canned transaction?
  answer: A canned transaction is a standard type of query/update, with carefully programmed data validity checking.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Describe the types of end users involved in a database environment.
  answer: 1) Casual end users = occassionally access database but need different info each time, use sophisticated query language. <br><br> 2) Naive/parametric users = make up sizeable portion of users, use canned transactions. <br><br> 3) Sophisticated end users = implement own apps, e.g. engineers. <br><br> 4) Stand-alone end users = maintain personal databases using off-the-shelf systems.

  question: Define Relational Model?
  answer: An attempt to describe data by its natural structure only.

  question: What is atomic?
  answer: Each value in domain is indivisable as far as relational model is concerned.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Relational Model
  question: What is a Degree and give an example?

- module: SCC201
  topic: Relational Model
  question: What is a superkey?
  answer: Subset of attributes is called a superkey. <br> All tuples in a relation are distinct - no tuples can have same combination.

  question: Define Cadidate Key?
  answer: If a relation schema has more than one key, each of the keys is called a candidate key.

  question: Define Primary Key?
  answer: a candidate key whose vlaues are used to identify tuples in a relation.

# 7. Normalisation
- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 1NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 2NF?
  answer:  Specifically, a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation. A non-prime attribute of a relation is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 3NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
