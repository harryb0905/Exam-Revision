  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the two problems of using a relational file?
  answer: 1) Limits on field lengths. <br> 2) Expense of setting up and maintaining the database. More costs for a bigger organisation as got to have high security for sensitive data.

  question: What are the problems of having multiple files?
  answer: 1) More files to maintain. <br> 2) Performance penalty accessing multiple files. <br> 3) Danger of data duplication. <br> 4) Adding/deleting records is a problem but not reading.

  question: When not to use DBMS?
  answer: 1) Database are simple and not expected to change. <br> 2) Stringent real-time requirements for some programs = DBMS overhead costs. <br> 3) Multiple-user access to data is not required.

  question: What is atomic?
  answer: Each value in domain is indivisable as far as relational model is concerned.

  topic: Relational Model
  question: What is a Degree and give an example?
  answer: The degree of a relation is the number of attributes n of its relation schema. <br> A relation schema for a relation of degree 4 (describing university students is LITTLE STUDENT (Name, Age, RegNum, Major)

  question: What is a superkey?
  answer: Subset of attributes is called a superkey. <br> All tuples in a relation are distinct - no tuples can have same combination.

  question: Define Cadidate Key?
  answer: If a relation schema has more than one key, each of the keys is called a candidate key.

  question: Define Primary Key?
  answer: a candidate key whose vlaues are used to identify tuples in a relation.

# 7. Normalisation
- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 1NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 2NF?
  answer:  Specifically, a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation. A non-prime attribute of a relation is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 3NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
