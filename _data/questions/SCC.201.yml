  question: What is meant by a relational file?
  answer: A relational file contains a number of records. Each record has a defined set of attributes.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the two problems of using a relational file?
  answer: 1) Limit on field lengths. <br> 2) Expense of setting up and maintaining the database. More costs for a bigger organisation as high security for sensitive data is required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the problems of having multiple traditional files?
  answer: 1) More files to maintain. <br> 2) Performance penalty accessing multiple files. <br> 3) Danger of data duplication. <br> 4) Adding/deleting records.

  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the 3 things to abstract from the application software?
  answer: 1) Data structure. <br> 2) Data values. <br> 3) Data access.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain what is meant by data independence.
  answer: Data independence is the idea that generated and stored data should be kept separate from apps that use the data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly describe the components involved in a DBMS.
  answer: 1) App program = send queries, receive results through logical interface. <br><br> 2) DBMS = contains data access software (code to process queries and handle data access), communicates with database. <br><br> 3) Database = physical data on backing store (contains data and data definition metadata).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the two views of DBMS and give some explanation?
  answer: 1) Logical view = presented to applications. <br> 2) Physical layout = on backing store, manipulated by DBMS.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is the purpose of the logical level in a DBMS?
  answer: Can access info without affecting existing apps (allows apps to define subset of logical view they wish to see).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain the purpose of data independence.
  answer: Can organise both contents and structure of the data (provided logical view presented to app programmer and end-user remains consistent).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly explain why databases are perceived to be better than traditional files.
  answer: 1) Data independence. <br> 2) Clever access methods/physical methods help speed up access times.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: How does a database provide data independence?
  answer: Through data abstraction. Doesn't include details of how data is stored, hides storage and implementation details of no interest to most users.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is stored in a system catalogue?
  answer: 1) Data definitions. <br> 2) Storage structure of data items. <br> 3) Constraints.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Describe the problems associated with traditional file processing.
  answer: Users may define and implement files needed for each specific app. Separate files need to be maintained (and programs to manipulate them). Wasted storage, redundant effort to keep common data consistent.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is meant by a view?
  answer: A view contains only what each app wants to see and only what it needs to see, keeping rest hidden (security). May be virtual (not stored) so no wasted space and no redundant effort maintaining common data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Explain the following terms; Entity, Attributes, Relationships.
  answer: Entity = specific object, real or abstract about which we need to store attributes and relationships. <br><br> Attributes = properties describing an entity. <br><br> Relationships = associations among entites.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a record?
  answer: A collection of related data values, which describe an entity and its attributes.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a record type? Give an example.
  answer: A collection of field names and their corresponding data types. <br><br> Person - String name, Int age, String NI_Number. <br> Person record = instance of person.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What is a schema?
  answer: A schema allows a user to declare types of records required (e.g. Person) and types of relationships among records. <br><br> A roadmap for data eventually stored (metadata = info about data).

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the overhead costs of a DBMS?
  answer: 1) High initial investment in; hardware, software, training. <br> 2) General approach for defining and processing data. <br> 3) Providing security, concurrency control, recovery and integrity functions.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: When not to use DBMS?
  answer: 1) Database is simple and not expected to change. <br> 2) Stringent real-time requirements for some programs = DBMS overhead costs. <br> 3) Multiple-user access to data is not required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: What are the actors involved in a Database System Environment?
  answer: 1) Database Administrator. <br> 2) Database Designers. <br> 3) Software Engineers. <br> 4) End Users.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Briefly explain what a database is.
  answer: A database represents some aspect of a real/mini world, logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Who is a database admin?
  answer: A database admin authorises access to a database, coordinates and monitors its use, and acquires software and hardware resources as required.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Who is a database designer?
  answer: A database designer identifies data to be stored in the database, and chooses appropriate structures and constraints to represent and store data.

  question: What is a canned transaction?
  answer: A canned transaction is a standard type of query/update, with carefully programmed data validity checking.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Why Databases
  question: Describe the types of end users involved in a database environment.
  answer: 1) Casual end users = occassionally access database but need different info each time, use sophisticated query language. <br><br> 2) Naive/parametric users = make up sizeable portion of users, use canned transactions. <br><br> 3) Sophisticated end users = implement own apps, e.g. engineers. <br><br> 4) Stand-alone end users = maintain personal databases using off-the-shelf systems.

  answer: Language to describe operations in relational DBMS (helps understanding Query execution and optimisation).

# 4. Schemas and Views
- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Define Schema.
  answer: A schema is a "roadmap" of data to be eventually stored. Used to sometimes be refferred to as meta-data.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: What do Schemas allow the user to do?
  answer: 1) Declare types of records required for e.g. Person, Company etc. <br> 2) Declare types of relationships among records for e.g. Person works for company, company employs person etc.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: What are the 3 levels of abstraction that allow various users to view physical database?
  answer: Internal level, conceptual level and external view.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Define internal level.
  answer: Defines physical implementation of database (storage files that contain actual data records). <br> A database as a collection of logical records called "internal" or "stored" records. <br> internal names of fields and no. of byes they occupy.  

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Define Conceptual Level.
  answer: Entire information resource at an abstract level for community of users. <br> Hideas details of physical storage structures, concentrating on - <br> Entities represented in the database <br> Relationships between those entities <br> Data types.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Define External view?
  answer: Describes database view of one group of database users. Includes a number of external schemas or user views.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Give a description about Externval view?
  answer: Each view is subset of conceptual level, defined & formatted according to user requirements. 

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: DBMS do not apply seperations cleanly - will include details of physical level in conceptual schema. <br> e.g. how many bytes can appear in a string field. <br> Most DBMS support user/external views, external schemas are expressed in same model as conceptual schema.
  answer:

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: What is physical independence?
  answer: Capacity to change internal schema without having to change conceptual or external schema. 

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: Following from previous question, why do you need to do changes to internal schema?
  answer: 1) Physical file organisation. <br> 2) Introduction, removal or modification of access paths = improve performance of retrieval on update

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: What are the overheads of three schema architecture?
  answer: 1) Mapping between three schema levels - request has to be mapped at each level for processing. <br> 2) Mappings time-consumiing and resource intensive.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: In External Views there are two types. Name them and give a description of each.
  answer: 1) Base Relation - Named relation corresponding to entity in conceptual schema, whose tuples are physically stored in database. <br> 2) View - Dynamic result of one or more relational operations operating on base relations to produce another relation. 

- module: SCC201
  topic: Schemas and Views
  question: What is Logical Data Independence?
  answer: Capacity to change conceptual schema without having to change external schemas or application program. Works when change is additive. e.g. adding an attribute to a relation. <br> More difficult to achieve when removing attribute from a relation. View definitions and mapping to conceptual schema needs to be changed.

# 7. Normalisation
- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 1NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 2NF?
  answer:  Specifically, a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation. A non-prime attribute of a relation is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation.

- module: SCC201
  topic: Normalisation
  question: What is the 3NF?
  answer: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
