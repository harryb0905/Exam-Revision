  answer: Empathise<br>Define<br>Ideate<br>Prototype<br>Test

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Empathise step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Understanding the way users do things and why, their physical and emotional needs and how they think about the world.<br><br>Understanding problem deeply by talking to people. Physical and emotional needs

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Define step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: framing the right problem us only way to create right solution. <br> Craft an actionable problem statement - your "point of view" of the user, what they need and why.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Ideate step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Explore innovative and alternative solutions in preparation for prototyping.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Prototype step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Generate artefacts intended to help you answer questions to bring you closer to a final solution (starts with 'quick and dirty' then progresses to high-fidelity).

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Test step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Solicit (ask for/try to obtain) feedback on prototypes created (leads to deeper understanding of the user and their needs).

# 3. User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: What is UCD?
  answer: It is an iterative methodology that puts the user at the centre of all design decisions.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: What's the goal of UCD?
  answer: To optimize a user's experience of a system, product or process.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: The gold rule is to know your user, name some uer perspectives during development lifecycle. 
  answer: 1) Abilities, real needs and 'wants'. <br> 2) Goals motivations and triggers. <br> 3) Context of use.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: Name three economic benefits and three social benefits of UCD.
  answer: Economic <br> 1) Decreased development costs. 2) Increased revenue from sales. <br> 3) Reduced training from sales, training costs. <br> Social <br> 1) Increased adoption rates by user. <br> 2) Improved user productivity. <br> 3) Higher quality user experience.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: Name three disadvantages of UCD.
  answer: 1) Users may be wrong. <br> 2) Users may be resistant to change. <br> 3) users may expect disadvantages such as computers taking control.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question:  Give three techniques of need-finding.
  answer: Participant observation, interviews and camera observation.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques
  question: What is the goal of participant observation and why?
  answer: To understand the user's needs, goals, values. <br> Why - helps to build empathy and think from their point-of-view.

- module: SCC202
  topic: User-Centered Design and Need-Finding Techniques

  question: Name three other types of need-finding methods and give a description for each.
  answer: 1) Diary Studies - Users complete a diary at specific time. Use strucutured task to seek specific info. <br> 2) Experience Sampling - Remind people at regular interval to record soem information such as emotion, energy level. Use phones to record. <br> 3) Logging Studies - Use software to log user's behaviour.

- module: SCC202
  topic: Need-Finding and Requirements
  question: Name two types of requirements.
