# 1. Intro to HCI
- module: SCC202
  topic: Intro to HCI
  question: Describe what HCI is involved with.
  answer: Discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

- module: SCC202
  topic: Intro to HCI
  question: State the different parts of the user interface.
  answer: Conceptual design (tasks, objects)<br>Visual design (graphics, layout, navigation)<br>Input and interaction (models, techniques)

- module: SCC202
  topic: Intro to HCI
  question: Define what is meant by the term user experience.
  answer: Total experience of an interactive solution, understanding at deep level what users need, designing solutions not just usable but satisfying and pleasing

- module: SCC202
  topic: Intro to HCI
  question: Define the 3 economic views involved in HCI.
  answer: Business view = use humans more productively and effectively (human costs outweigh hardware/software costs<br><br>Personal view = people view computers as appliances and what them to perform like appliances<br><br>Marketplace view = everyone uses computers and expect them to be easy to use, not tolerant of poorly designed systems

# 2. HCI and Design Thinking
- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain what is meant by the term 'Design Thinking' in the context of HCI.
  answer: Process for solving problems in creative and innovative way.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: What is a designer's toolkit in the context of HCI?
  answer: Techniques that help understand users and problems, and find new ways of addressing them.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: State the 5 steps involved in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Empathise<br>Define<br>Ideate<br>Prototype<br>Test

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Empathise step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Understanding the way users do things and why, their physical and emotional needs and how they think about the world.<br><br>Understanding the problem more deeply, talking to people, how they think about something etc.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Define step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Craft an actionable problem statement - your "point of view" of the user, what they need and why.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Ideate step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Explore innovative and alternative solutions in preparation for prototyping.

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Prototype step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Generate artefacts intended to help you answer questions to bring you closer to a final solution (starts with 'quick and dirty' then progresses to high-fidelity).

- module: SCC202
  topic: HCI and Design Thinking
  question: Explain the Test step in the Design Thinking Process.
  answer: Solicit (ask for/try to obtain) feedback on prototypes created (leads to deeper understanding of the user and their needs).
